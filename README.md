# Security App

This app is secured by a password (by default "password") and you can modify it.  
In this app, you'll can crypt and decrypt a message with a key using a symertical crypting.  
Also, you'll can generate secured password and test yours.  
Finally, you'll can save whatever your want in the Passwords Manager which is also crypted with your password's hash.

You can customize the app by changing the palet at the left top and the language (English or French) at the right top.
All this things will be saved in the user_data.json file.
