# Security App

This app is secured by a password (by default "password") and you can modify it.  
In this app, you can crypt and decrypt a message with a key using a symmetric encryption.  
Also, you can generate secured passwords and test yours.  
Finally, you can save whatever your want in the Passwords Manager which is also crypted with your password's hash.

You can customize the app by changing the palet at the left top and the language (English or French) at the right top.
All this settings and datas will be saved in the user_data.json file.
